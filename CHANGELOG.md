# Changelog

## [0.2.1] — 2026-04-21

### Fixed

- Depth-aware gloss splitter: DICTLINE meanings with `;` inside `[...]` or `(...)` (e.g. `[neque..neque=>neither..nor; neque solum..sed etiam=>not only..but also]`) now split at top-level semicolons only, preserving bracketed/parenthetical annotations. Affected ~80 entries.
- PACKON pronouns (`quisquam`, `quisque`, `quidam`, `quispiam`, `quilibet`, `quivis`, `quicumque`) now have lexicon entries. Their paradigms are assembled from pronoun stem + TACKON and have no DICTLINE record, so `token._.lexicon` returned empty for all forms. Build now synthesizes a DictEntry per lemma, with glosses sourced verbatim from ADDONS.LAT PACKON comments.

## [0.2.0] — 2026-04-16

### Performance

- Lazy-load lexicon and analyzer in spaCy components — `add_pipe` drops from ~500ms to <1ms; data is loaded on first document processing
- Use `str.translate` for v→u / j→i normalization instead of chained `.replace()` calls
- Pre-lowercase inflection endings and unique forms at build/export time, removing redundant `.lower()` calls at runtime

### Internal

- Prune dev-only modules from package surface
